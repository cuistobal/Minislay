MAN:
	->	TD	->	Still needs to be done	
	->	OK	->	Done and implemented
	->	OG	->	Ongoing implementation
	->	OGT	->	Ongoing test phase
	->	TDB	->	To be discussed

OG	->	Read, Test & Modify the lexer's new version.

	OK	->	Enforce norminette.
		
	TD	->	Modify the tester to ensure syntax rules are correctly handled

TD	->	Modify the **token_list's structure.

		We need 1 sublist per () block to prepare the execution_tree() && subshell()
		modules.
		
		Example:

		((echo "bonjour" || echo "au revoir") && (echo "toi" || echo "iot")) && echo "gg wp"	
		
		S0S1:																	S0S2:
		((echo "bonjour" || echo "au revoir") && (echo "toi" || echo "iot"))	echo "gg wp"

		S1S1:								S1S2:								
		echo "bonjour" || echo "au revoir"	echo "toi" || echo "iot"

TBD	->	Also, how does execution knows where the fds are without traversing the
		whole tree ?
