Grammar Definition for Bash POSIX Syntax

1. Terminals

Operators: 

  Redirections: >, >>, <, <<

  Punctuation (?): &&, ||, |

  Subshells (?): (, )

  Expansions: *, $,=

Literals: 
  
  Words: representing general tokens like command names, filenames, etc.

2. Non-Terminals

  Script
  Command
  SimpleCommand
  Pipeline
  CommandList
  Redirection
  CompoundCommand
  Expression
  Assignment

3. Production Rules

	Script           →	CommandList

	CommandList      →	Command ( '&&' | '||' ) CommandList | Command

	Command          →	CompoundCommand | SimpleCommand | Pipeline 

	CompoundCommand  →	'(' CommandList ')'
	
	SimpleCommand    →	Assignment* WORD (Argument | Redirection)*
	
	Assignment       →	WORD '=' Expression
	Expression       →	'$' WORD | WORD
	Argument         →	WORD
	
	Pipeline         →	Command ( '|' Command )*
	
	Redirection      →	( '>' | '>>' | '<' | '<<' ) WORD
	
	CompoundCommand  →	'(' CommandList ')'

4. Operator Precedence (Highest to Lowest)

  (): Grouping commands  
  *, $, =: Parameter expansion, globbing, assignment
  Redirections: >, >>, <, <<
  Pipelining: |
  Logical Operators: &&, ||

5. Notes on Implementation

  Leftmost Derivation: 
  Always expand the leftmost non-terminal first. For instance, while parsing a=b && echo $b, begin by expanding the assignment a=b, then move to the logical operator &&, and finally parse the echo $b command.

  Recursive Descent Parsing:
  This grammar is mostly suitable for a recursive descent parser. Pay attention to left recursion in rules like CommandList, which may need to be restructured to avoid infinite recursion.
